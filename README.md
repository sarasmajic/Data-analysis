# About it
During interview process I was given a task (task_student_2024) where I needed to identify and predict the variables that
have most impact on target variable (DlqIn2Yrs - delinquent in 2 years). In simple terms, how do we predict which customers
are most likely unable to make payment due given date. 

## Solutions
I did the task with 3 different methods; correlation (matrix) table, linear model and neural network. 
All solutions and its results are explained and presented in html file, which was made with Quarto.
